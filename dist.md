Working with Dist
=================

I have managed to get atlas to install with dist (sortof).  Follow the dist guide, create a separate pkg/atlas instead of pkg/hello under urbit-git, then cp all the urbit files from here to a %atlas desk, as well as copying the pkg/atlas files into the %atlas desk.
